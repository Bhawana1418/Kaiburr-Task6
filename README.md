Task 6. Data Science example.
Performing text classification on a consumer complaint dataset involves several steps. Here's a general outline of the process to be followed:

**Step 1: Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering**
- Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure.
- Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
- Perform data visualization to gain insights into the data distribution and class balance.
- Consider feature engineering, such as creating new features or extracting relevant information from the existing ones.

**Step 2: Text Pre-Processing**
- Tokenize the text data: Split text into individual words or tokens.
- Remove stop words: Common words like "and," "the," "in" may not provide valuable information.
- Perform stemming or lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
- Handle text encoding: Convert text data to numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**Step 3: Selection of Multi-Classification Model**
- Choose a suitable multi-class classification algorithm. Common choices include:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, CNN)
- I have used Random Forest Classifier.

**Step 4: Comparison of Model Performance**
- Train the selected models on the training dataset.
- Evaluate the models on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Select the model that performs the best on your evaluation metrics.

**Step 5: Model Evaluation**
- Interpret the results and evaluate how well the chosen model classifies consumer complaints.
- Analyze any potential biases or limitations in the model's predictions.
- Fine-tune the model if necessary to improve its performance.

**Step 6: Prediction**
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen consumer complaints.
- Implement a user-friendly interface or application to allow users to input their complaints and receive predictions about the category.
